# Pong Browser Game Specification

## Overview

This specification outlines the requirements for creating a Pong browser game. The game will be implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and should run in a Chrome browser. The game will have two paddles: one controlled by the user through arrow keys and the other controlled by the computer.

## Gameplay

The Pong game will have the following rules:

1. The game will be played on a rectangular playing field with a fixed size.
2. There will be two paddles: one for the user and one for the computer.
3. The paddles will be positioned on the left and right edges of the playing field.
4. The user-controlled paddle will be moved up and down using the arrow keys.
5. The computer-controlled paddle will automatically move up and down to follow the ball's position.
6. The game will have a ball that moves across the playing field, bouncing off the walls and paddles.
7. When the ball collides with the user's paddle, it will change its direction, simulating a bounce.
8. When the ball collides with the computer's paddle, it will change its direction, simulating a bounce.
9. The game will have a score counter to keep track of the user's score and the computer's score.
10. The game will end when either the user or the computer reaches a specific score limit (e.g., 10 points).
11. When the game ends, a message will be displayed indicating the winner.

## User Interface

The user interface will be designed using HTML and CSS. The following elements should be included:

1. A rectangular playing field to display the game.
2. Two vertical paddles, one on the left and one on the right, representing the user's paddle and the computer's paddle, respectively.
3. A ball that moves across the playing field.
4. A score counter for the user and the computer.
5. A message to display the winner when the game ends.

## Controls

The user will control their paddle using the following keyboard controls:

- Up Arrow: Move the user's paddle upward.
- Down Arrow: Move the user's paddle downward.

## Styling

All styling of the game should be done using CSS. The design should be simple and responsive, ensuring that the game looks good on different screen sizes and orientations.

## Requirements

The Pong game should work efficiently in the Google Chrome browser and be compatible with modern web standards. The game should not use any images; all visual elements should be created using HTML and CSS.

## Implementation

The Pong game will be implemented using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for game logic and interactivity.

The game should be organized into separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For example:

index.html     # HTML file for the game structure
pong.css       # CSS file for styling the game
pong.js        # JavaScript file for game logic and interactivity

## Additional Features (Optional)

Optionally, the following features can be added to enhance the game:

1. Sound Effects: Add sound effects for paddle-ball collisions and scoring points.
2. Difficulty Levels: Allow the user to choose from different difficulty levels for the computer-controlled paddle.
3. Mobile Support: Implement touch controls for mobile devices to allow users to play the game on touchscreens.
4. Pause/Restart: Add options to pause and restart the game during gameplay.

These additional features can be considered after implementing the core functionality of the Pong browser game.
